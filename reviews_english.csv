Borobudur Temple,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIa3M2eGdnRRAB,The temple is beautiful … but how they handle the ticket sales is terrible and feels corrupt. They tell you the tickets for the structure are sold out at the counter but you can buy tickets at double the price from resellers in front of the ticket office… We were lucky because some other group managed to negotiate tickets at the counter and even if they told us many times it was sold out they actually magically had “cancellation” ticket. I think it is very important to change this re-selling scam even more for a temple !!,23 hours ago,2024-09-04 11:32:14.967197,1.0,Meriem Boutaleb,2,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113386792441081502462/reviews?hl=en,NULL,en

Borobudur Temple,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3Z3FPdTl3RRAB,"Borobudur Temple is nothing short of a masterpiece, a testament to the grandeur and ingenuity of ancient civilizations. As one of the largest and most impressive Buddhist monuments in the world, it offers an awe-inspiring experience that is sure to leave a lasting impression on anyone fortunate enough to visit.  From the moment you approach Borobudur, the sheer scale and intricacy of the structure take your breath away. Each level of the temple reveals a new layer of stunning detail – from the intricately carved stone reliefs that tell stories of ancient wisdom to the towering stupas that stand as silent sentinels against the backdrop of lush green hills. The craftsmanship and artistry that went into creating this monument are truly remarkable.  As you ascend the terraces, you not only feel a sense of physical elevation but also a spiritual one. The journey to the top is symbolic, representing a path to enlightenment, and the panoramic views that greet you at the summit are nothing short of spectacular. Standing at the peak, surrounded by mist-covered mountains and the lush landscape of Central Java, you can’t help but feel a profound connection to the past and a deep appreciation for the cultural heritage that Borobudur represents.

Who can purchase the ticket for next to 25k rupiah then sell online for 1 million to tourists. The mark up from local to tourist is astronomical.  If you think that the temple itself may be of interest think again. There isn't even access to get close enough to view any carvings or statues. You basically can walk a perimeter then leave.  The perimeter you can walk around has zero carvings and is brand new, takes about 10 minutes. You keep thinking it's going to get better but it doesn't.  Don't think like me that they would at least let you on the first level. They have barricades around the whole place and you need a wrist band and special shoes to even step near the temple.  All you see is the brand new bricks they laid recently. You can't even view any bells or the top.  All the statues at the mid to higher levels have been decapitated and not replaced.

Borobudur Temple,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURiOTdiVEl3EAE,"For about three centuries, Matalan, located in the heart of the Progo Valley on the southern slopes of Mount Merapi, became the center of Javanese Hindu and Buddhist culture. This period witnessed many religious buildings, including the World Heritage Sites of Borobudur and Prambanan.  Borobudur is a Mahayana Buddhist temple built in the 8th and 9th centuries for more than a thousand years. It was buried in volcanic ash for hundreds of years and covered with jungles on the surface until it was discovered by the British in 1814 and reappeared in the world. Borobudur is the largest Buddhist building in the world today. It has 9 floors above ground and 6 floors below for the realm of desire and sex. It is rich in various reliefs. It depicts stories from Buddhist books and is 3 kilometers long. It tells the stories of ordinary beings from Palace life to the common people in the village. The upper three floors are the formless realm, which is the world of gods who are freed from reincarnation and no longer attached to the secular world. Therefore, there are no secular sculptures. There are 72 small bell-shaped pagodas surrounding the large pagoda in the middle.  Tickets cost NT$240 for locals and NT$900 for foreigners, which is not cheap based on local prices. However, since the restoration of historical sites requires a lot of manpower and money, it is better to pay if you have the money.",3 weeks ago,2024-09-04 11:34:49.752381,5.0,JIE-CHAO YOU,164,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114742758257739280536/reviews?hl=en,NULL,en

Borobudur Temple,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURiZzc3WUd3EAE,"- The temple itself is very impressive! Staffs here are supper friendly, helpful and supportive. However, my impression about this place was not really good and i did not really enjoy. So, overall I just rate 3 stars. - I did not search much infomation before my visit, so a little bit confused at first :)). Things i dont like: 1, very very crowded. 2, foreigners must scan QR code to buy ticket in the system by themselves, even you are alr there, they dont support buy ticket at the counter. Very inconvenient! 3, the ticket price is such expensive and again, foreigners always pay much more than local people. 4, you must go with a tour guide and a group when going up to the temple and just have an hour, so not really felt free. 5, finally, you have to pass through many vendors and shops to go out even you dont like shopping and no choice. - My advise: 1, abt transportation, you can take a minivan (20k rp) in front of Bank Indonesia to get to Borobudur bus terminal and walk abt 2km to get to the temple. 2, very important: you should buy ticket in advance and buy 'temple structure ticket' (445k rp), if you want to go up to the temple, because tickets are sold out quickly. I arrived at 11 am and did not buy ticket in advance, just a few tickets left at last sessions 2.30 and 3.30 pm. And just 30 mins later, all tickets were sold out. Though i had to wait but i was still lucky. 3, if your credit card has issue in payment step, you can choose a convenient store nearby and pay there. 4, they will give you flip-flops and you must change shoes before going up to the temple. 5, For 'temple ground ticket' (400k rp), you can buy at the ticket counter and don't need to wait, don't need a tour guide and you can go by yourself, but for this kind of ticket, they just allow you to walk around the yard, not allow to go up to the temple.

Borobudur Temple,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURiOEkzeTRBRRAB,"""Borobudur"" comes from the Sanskrit ""Vihara Buddha Ur"", which means ""Buddhist temple on the top of the mountain"" and is a Mahayana architectural relic. Borobudur is the largest Buddhist site in the world. This giant building took hundreds of thousands of craftsmen and took decades. It is known as the ""Pyramid of Indonesia"", and is similar to the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal of India, and the Taj Mahal of Cambodia. Angkor Wat is also known as the four wonders of the ancient East. Summit tickets can only be purchased on the official website. But if you sign up for a group tour, you can ask the driver to add money to buy it separately. If you book online, if you don't book many days in advance, you usually won't have a ticket. Anyway, it's a good thing to add some money! In short, the ticket prices have changed and become more expensive.

The higher to the top you get, the more enlightened the humans appear in the stone carvings. There are a lot of Buddha statues and unfortunately some without heads.

The entrance to the top of the complex is closed and opens at 8:30. So, in any case, meeting the sunrise is not an option. Just closed. Take it for the last session - for sunset.  The exit from the park is 1 km along the shopping arcades. Mercilessly. Fortunately, that part was closed in the morning.  And then it’s a long, long time to go looking for a place to park the bike. You can also move around the park on foot. In the morning there are no carts or rental vehicles.

The guide told us that a long time ago this place was submerged under water & the land rises during an earthquake which dries up the cave.

As a foreigner, I'm a bit angry that we are fooled by these tactics, where you pay an entrance fee and then there are all these extras you need to pay such as a tour guide.

Gua Batu Cermin,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzaXJPQ1B3EAE,"Mirror Rock Cave (Indonesian: Goa Batu Cermin) can be said to be another famous attraction in Labuan Bajo besides waterfalls. However, the so-called Mirror Rock Cave is actually just a cave. The thick-browed boy has seen a lot of it before. There is a large bamboo forest along the road from the entrance of the scenic spot to the entrance of the cave. It is elegant and very cool, making it more comfortable as you walk. After walking for about 10 minutes, we reached the entrance of Jingshi Cave. Unexpectedly, the rocks in the cave have strange shapes and come in many different colors, which dazzled the thick-browed boy. The rock wall near the entrance of the cave is occupied by tree roots, giving it an atmosphere of searching for secrets. The tour guide told us that this area was the seabed in ancient times. The evidence is that there are many fossils of corals and other marine life on the rocks. It's pitch dark inside the cave, so bring a flashlight. There is a prehistoric turtle fossil in the cave, which is so completely preserved that even the head is clearly identifiable. From time to time, shell fossils are found on the rock wall, just like a fossil museum. There is a fossil of a prehistoric fish near the entrance of the cave, and the fins are still clearly visible. Although the place is not big, the rock shapes here are extremely beautiful, and you can see fossils, so it is definitely worth a visit.",4 years ago,2024-09-18 09:10:54.528188,5.0,Chou Meizai (粗眉仔),"1,771",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100714570987698832571/reviews?hl=en,NULL,en

Shortly before the entrance you get a helmet, which is also necessary. If it is not possible due to health reasons to walk a few meters while crouching down, you can save yourself the visit. In the cave itself you are shown some particularly beautiful shapes, bats (which sometimes fly close), fossil finds and of course the room from which the cave gets its name. No matter what travel guides write, there is no ONE TIME where everything reflects. You don't have to be an astronomer to understand that the position of the sun varies daily.

Sirkuit Internasional Pertamina Mandalika,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNab0puN3ZRRRAB,This Racetrack doesn't make sense. It was built on local land and people that used to live on the land were told they would get reimbursed. To this date this never happened. (You can research all of this in detail online) I guess it attracts some tourists but at this point of time it just feels incredibly out of place. They are still building big roads around the circuit that nobody even uses. When a race is one it gets incredible loud so that the beaches around the circuit aren't for relaxing anymore,a year ago,2024-09-18 09:25:35.433955,1.0,Paul KR,212,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106550692739130196390/reviews?hl=en,NULL,en
